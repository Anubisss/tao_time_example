===============================================================================



   tao_time_example contains a server and a client. This project is a simple
exmaple which purpose is to presents a basic introduction into TAO.
   TAO (The ACE ORB) is a CORBA (Common Object Request Broker Architecture)
implementation using the ACE (Adaptive Communication Environment) C++
framework.
   For more info check http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/TAO.html
                       http://www.corba.org/

Some notes:
    -    Time.idl (src/idl/Time.idl) is the file where the Time interface is
      defined. This means that defination is programming language independent
      so the server and the client can be written in different languages. The
      implementation of the Time interface (class) should be in the server-side
      code.
    -    There is an IDL compiler there: libs/idl_compiler/tao_idl.exe This
      compiler "compiles" the Time interface into C++ source files. With these
      sources this IDL interface can be used in "any" C++ code. This IDL
      compilation is automated in this project so Visual Studio take care
      of that.

How to use:
    -   First of all the client have to find where (ip/port) is the server
      running. This can be done simply via the CORBA Naming Service.
    -   libs/naming_service/tao_cosnaming.exe
      This is TAO's implementation of Naming Service. The most simple thing is
      running the server, the client and the Naming Service in the same box.
      In that way you should just run the Naming Service with "-m 1"
      parameters. This enables multicast responses.
        For more info about params just check README file in
      Naming Service's directory.
    -   Now just start server then client and that's all.
        Should work as intended.
